## Tools

* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - Used as a cloud-based IDE.
* [Github](https://github.com/) - Used to secure code online.

## Testing

* Theres a bug that doesn't allow the shuffling funcion to shuffle the cards in the pool all together.
- I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of Jest tests would be more comprehensive.
