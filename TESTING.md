## Bugs

* ~~Theres was a bug that wouldn't allow the shuffling funcion to shuffle the cards in the pool all together.~~ This was fixed by removing the unnecessary bootstrap rows so that all cards were within the same parent element (row).

### Unfixed bugs

* There are no unfixed bugs that I am currently aware of.
